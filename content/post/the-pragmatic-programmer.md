These are my notes related to this incredible book. I really recommend
for every developer that wants to be a Pragmatic Programmer (a good and
efficient developer).

### Insights

* Always try news things
	* If you use IDE, try EDITOR like [vim](https://www.vim.org/)
	* If you are a
	  [Object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
	  developer, try to
	  [Functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
	* ...
* **Feedback Loop** -- As an agile programmer you always should take small steps, and this
	isn't only thinking about code, refactor or something related to it. Is
	about the team process too, we shouldn't expected you follow the Scrum
	or the Kanban blindly. We expected you follow this steps to find your
	goals:
	1. Find out where you are
	1. Take a small step towards your goal
	1. Adjust your understanding based on what you learned
	1. Repeat
	* When faced with two or more alternatives that deliver roughly the
	same value, always take the path that makes future change easier
* Don't live with broke window
* The Moral Compass:
	* Have I protected the user?
	* Would I use this feature/app myself?
* It's about your life, share it, celebrate it, build it, and please,
	have too much fun!!!

### A Pragmatic Philosophy

* It's your life
* Good-Enough Software 
* Goals (we can do this?)
	* Learn at least one new language every year
	* Read a technical book each month
	* Read a nontechnical books, too
	* Take classes
	* Participate in local user groups and meetups
	* Experiment with different environments
	* Stay current

### A Pragmatic Approach

* [Don't repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
* Keep track your estimating 

### The Basic Tools

* Use daybooks to take notes in meetings, to jot down what we're working
  on, to note variable values when debugging, to leave reminders where
  we put things, to record wild ideas, and sometimes just a doodle

### Pragmatic Paranoia

* [Design by contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract)

### Bend, or Break

* Always maintain a configuration as a service (configuration data
  becomes dynamic), we move toward highly available applications. We
  don't expected restart some service because we change some
  configuration
* Transform data, converting input into an output
	* When we think of programs as something that transform input into
	  output, many of the details we worried about just evaporate	

### While You Are Coding

* Code needs to evolve; it's not a static thing
* Time pressure is often used as an excuse for not refactoring
* Refactor Early, Refactor Often
* Don't try to refactor and add new features at the same time (same time
  means what? Same commit? Same Jira issue?)
* Make sure you have good tests before refactor
* Tip 68: Build end-to-end, not top-down or bottom up
* Honor the local culture
	* Don't think you are intelligent because you learn
	  [Go](https://go.dev/) and you don't put the word `get` before some
	  object property method in [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) like
	  `name()` instead `getName()`. Please, don't be dumb as I am, *Honor
	  the local culture*. 

### Before the Project

* A good design produces something that's easier to change than a bad
  design
* Maintain a Glossary
	* It's hard to succeed on a project if users and developers call the
	  same thing by different names or, even worse, refer to different
	  things by the same name

### Pragmatic Projects

* We don't expected team members discourages another members from
	spending time on broken window fixes (naming things right, test code
	aren't tested, ...) 
* The team must take responsibility for the quality of the product
* The whole team not tolerate broken window
